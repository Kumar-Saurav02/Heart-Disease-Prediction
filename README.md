# Heart-Disease-Prediction
<strong>A project using machine learning to anticipate heart disease with great accuracy.<br>
Provides the findings based on the information you provided to determine whether or not you have a heat illness.</storng>

 # Alogorithms Used
 <h3>This project uses</h3> 
 <li>Logistic Regression</li><br>
 <li> Support Vector Machines</li><br>
 <li>XGBOOST algorithms</li><br>
 <li>Cross Validation, GridSearch CV and Bayesian Optimization were used respectively for Hyperparameter Tuning.</li><br>

 # Results
 Several Accuracy metrices were used to judge the performance of the models.<br>
 Final Accuracy:<br> 
    <li> Logistic Regression=  81.35%</li><br>
    <li> SVM= 83.15%</li><br>
    <li> XGBoost= 85.32%</li>
